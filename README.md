**Do you like plants?** I know bees do, and I do, too! Help [save the bees](https://thebeeconservancy.org/10-ways-to-save-the-bees/)!

Here is a picture of one of my bee bombs (with wildflower seeds): <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lillekenal/lillekenal.github.io/main/beeBomb1.jpg" alt="drawing" width="300"/>

Here are a number of my packaged bee bombs: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lillekenal/lillekenal.github.io/main/beeBombPkgs1.jpg" alt="drawing" width="300"/>

These "bee bombs" do not hurt bees, but help them pollinate flowers and make honey.

Please do not use pesticides on any of your plants; this kills the bees, and doesn't really help much.  My plants are growing great without pesticides.
